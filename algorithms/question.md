### 3. WarmUp
* Q1. Counting Inversions
	- Desc: For a list of number 1,2,3,..,n randomly ordered, calculate the pairs of number ordered inversely, which means the small number was behind the big number.
	- Time Complexity: `O(n*log2n)`
	- Input: array A containing the numbers 1,2,3,..,n in some arbitrary order
	- Output: number of inversions = number of pairs (i,j) 
		of array indices with i < j and A[i] > A[j]
	- eg. Input: [1,3,5,2,4,6]. Output: 3.   which is (3,2), (5,2), (5,4)
	- eg. Input: [17, 9, 12, 19, 16, 5, 3, 0, 18, 2, 14, 6, 7, 4, 1, 13, 11, 10, 8, 15]. Output: 106
